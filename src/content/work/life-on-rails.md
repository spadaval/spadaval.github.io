Life On Rails is a combined goal-habit-task tracker meant to help you keep your life on track.

# The Tech

Life On Rails is a Next.js app, built in React 18 and deployed on Netlify.
We used tailwind for styling.

# About The Product

## The Problem

The human mind is not designed for hunting mammoths in small tribes, not the complexities of modern life.

In today's world, success requires long-term strategic planning, good decisions, and good habits.  

A quick look through the internet will surface untold numbers of task trackers, at at least a dozen good habit trackers. 

So, then, why does this exist?

In a word, perspective. More than anything else, good decisions require perspective.  

## On Perspective

From city planning to operating a nuclear reactor to running a war, a thousand-foot view is essential to good strategic decision making. 

Therefore, it stands to reason that good strategic decision making in your life should also require a thousand-foot view of your life.

All the tools out there are excellent at achieving a single task well, but they don't really provide you with a thousand-feet view of your backlog, never mind your whole life.

## A Life on Rails

In our view, a good life is guided by good habits, all working together in harmony to achieve a set of goals.


In our app, we help you pick a set of goals, and habits that go with it. 
Over time, you'll track your adherence to these habits. 
With our scoring system, you'll know when you miss something, and what you need to do to get back on track.

The grand plan here also helps with motivation.

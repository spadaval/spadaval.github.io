Over about a year, we developed a bunch of features targeted at Jira Admins. 
These features were intended to support customers migrating from the on-premise version of Jira to Jira Cloud, filling in some feature gaps and adding certain features that helped them manage the intricacies of a cloud-native application. 

# The Tech

All of these features were built in the Jira Monolith; the gigantic monolithic application that runs most of Jira Cloud. It's a holdover from the on-premise version of the tool.
The Jira Monolith is built in Java 8 and runs on Apache Tomcat.
